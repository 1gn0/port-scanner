This tool is a basic port scanner made for fun using the python library socket and multithreading. On my computer, it takes around 25s to scan all ports. 

Usage : 

```python portscanner.py target_ip (IPv4 format) (port_min) (port_max)``` (The last ones are optional. You must specify a min_port for using the port_max option.)

optional arguments : 

-h (--help) : 
  Display how the tool should be used.

-s (--show) : 
  Show all ports tested and connection state.

Please report any bugs to discord user **1gn0**.

Have fun !
